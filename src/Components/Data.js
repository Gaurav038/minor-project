        info:"Haridwar, the gateway to the Gods, is situated on the right bank of the holy Ganga and is regarded among the seven sacred cities of India. Haridwar is also, the gateway to the four major pilgrimages- the Char Dham - Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. According to Hindu mythology, Haridwar is one of the four places where the drops of Amrita, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher or Kumbha, in which it was being carried away by Garuda, the celestial bird and the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. It is, therefore, one of the four venues where the Kumbh Mela ' said to the largest congregation of humanity anywhere in the world ' is held once every 12 years. Haridwar is also the place where the river Ganga enters the Indo-Gangetic plains for the first time. Haridwar is also home to several ashrams which specialize in teaching meditation and yoga."
