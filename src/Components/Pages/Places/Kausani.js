          para="The ideal way to explore this picturesque hill-station is to come without a plan. You can spend an entire day just watching the magical play of colours on the mountain peaks surrounding Kausani. This village, perched on a ridge covered with chir and blue pine forests, is most well-known for the spectacular panoramic view of the Himalayan peaks like Trishul, Nanda Devi, and the mighty Panchachuli. Enjoy a picture-perfect sunrise from one of the many viewing platforms in the village. As the sun peeps above the horizon, the snow-crested peaks take on every hue of the rising golden orb. 

Or you can explore the surrounding forests, filled with babbling creeks, chirping birds and serenity. A paradise for bird lovers, here you can spot more than 50 different species of birds such as woodpecker, barbet, parakeet, robin and fork tail. The Kausani Tea Estate is an apt location to spot birds. The Hrithik Roshan-starrer movie Koi Mil Gaya (2003) was mostly shot in Nainital, Bhimtaal and Kausani.
