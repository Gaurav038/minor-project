     para="Perhaps the most popular adventure sport in Rishikesh– be it the youth or even families nowadays – is white water rafting in the gushing rapids of the Ganges and Tons river in Uttarakhand. Whereas the white water rafting and camping near rapids from Shivpuri to Rishikesh have become the most popular weekend getaways activities of denizens of Delhi, visitors and thrill-seekers from around the globe head to Uttarakhand for river rafting in India. Recently white water rafting is also gaining popularity on the rapids of the Tons river near Mori."
