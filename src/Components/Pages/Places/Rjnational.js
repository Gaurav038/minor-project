           para="Close to the cities, yet offering a wild serenity that is exhilarating. That's the charm of the Rajaji National national park, most famous for its elephant population.  Located at the Himalayan foothills, near Haridwar, Rishikesh and Dehradun, with Ganga and Song rivers, flowing through it, the park is known for its scenic beauty and rich bio-diversity. A paradise for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts, the park is home to elephants, tigers, leopards, deers and ghorals, and a wide variety of birds. In 1983, three sanctuaries in Uttarakhand - Rajaji, Motichur and Chilla - were amalgamated into a large protected area and named Rajaji National Park, in honour of freedom fighter and and first governor general of India Late C Rajagopalachari; popularly known as “Rajaji”.

This area is the north-western limit of Asian elephants. Spread over an area of 820.42 sq km, Rajaji is a magnificent ecosystem nestled in the Shivalik ranges at the start of the vast Indo–Gangetic plains, thus representing vegetation of several distinct zones and forest types."
